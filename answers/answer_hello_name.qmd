To get input from the person running your script, you can use the [`input()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input) function.

If you pass a string argument to it, it will use that as the "prompt" when asking for input.


```{python}
#| filename: hello.py
#| eval: false
my_name = input("Please tell me your name: ")

name_length = len(my_name)

print(f"Hello {my_name}! Your name is {name_length} characters long")
```

```{.bash filename="Terminal/Command Prompt"}
python hello.py
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
my_name = "Matt"

print("Please tell me your name:", my_name)

name_length = len(my_name)

print(f"Hello {my_name}! Your name is {name_length} characters long")
```
