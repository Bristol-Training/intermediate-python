To get input from the person running your script, you can use the [`input()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input) function.

If you pass a string argument to it, it will use that as the "prompt" when asking for input.

```{python}
#| tags: [remove_cell]
%load_ext interactive_system_magic
```

```{python}
%%writefile hello.py

my_name = input("Please tell me your name: ")

name_length = len(my_name)

print(f"Hello {my_name}! Your name is {name_length} characters long")
```

```{python}
#| tags: []
%%run_python_script -i hello.py
