That's all we have for this workshop. By now you should have a better understanding of how you can make your code more easily shared and reusable. In this workshow we have covered:

- How to make you life easier with string formatting
- Using the Python standard library to find and use useful functions
- Ways of bundling up your code into reusable units with functions
- Making it possible to share your code with others by moving code into modules
- How to produce custom errors
- How to compactly generate lists with list comprehensions


## Worksheet

To give you something to take away with you to practise with, there is a [worksheet with questions](../appendix/appendix_practice_questions.qmd). If you get to this point in the session then feel free to start now, otherwise work on them between this session and the next.

## What's next

Once you're comfortable with the material in this course, I suggest having a look at our course on [best practices in software engineering](https://milliams.com/courses/software_engineering_best_practices/) which covers testing your code and writing documentation. Otherwise, if you haven't already, you may be interested in the course on [data analysis in Python](https://uob-data-science-training.github.io/introduction-to-data-analysis-in-python/).

If you want to get some practice with Python coding, take a look at [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/?language=python). This is a website which sets you small challenges and lets you discuss with others what the best solution might be.
