This course was originally written by Christopher Woods and published at <https://chryswoods.com/intermediate_python/>. Over many years of delivering the course at the University of Bristol, changes were made by the University's Advanced Computing Research Centre (ACRC). Under ACRC, the course development was led by Matt Williams, see <https://milliams.com/courses/intermediate_python/>.

The course has since been modified by the Jean Golding Institute.
